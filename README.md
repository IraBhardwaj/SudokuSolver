# SudokuSolver
Given a sudoku puzzle image, find the solution to the sudoku puzzle.

The proposed algorithm takes the image of the sudoku puzzle as input and returns the solved sudoku puzzle as the output. Simple image processing functions are used in the detection of the sudoku image to create a digital matrix. The matrix is then solved using basic logic to produce the solution of the puzzle. The algorithm is coded using python and for the image processing part OpenCV is used.
